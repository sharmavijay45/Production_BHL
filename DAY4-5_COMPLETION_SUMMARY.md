### 🤔 **DAY 4-5 REFLECTION**

#### **Humility** 🙏
- **Challenge**: Designing inter-service communication without tight coupling required careful API contract design
- **Learning**: Discovered the complexity of service discovery and load balancing in distributed systems
- **Assumption**: Initially underestimated the effort needed for comprehensive error handling across service boundaries

#### **Gratitude** 🙏
- **FastAPI Framework**: Excellent support for microservices with automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Pydantic Models**: Type safety across service boundaries made integration robust
- **Python Asyncio**: Enabled high-performance concurrent request handling
- **HTTP Standards**: RESTful patterns provided clear service contracts

#### **Honesty** 💭
- **Service Boundaries**: Some business logic spans multiple services (could be better separated)
- **Data Consistency**: Cross-service transactions need more sophisticated handling
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing across multiple services is challenging
- **Performance**: Network latency between services adds overhead compared to monolith

---

### 🎯 **DAY 6 PRIORITIES (SCALABILITY)**

#### **High Priority**
1. **Docker Containerization** - Create containers for each microservice
2. **Kubernetes Deployment** - Orchestrate containers with K8s
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
4. **Auto-scaling Policies** - Dynamic scaling based on load

#### **Medium Priority**
1. **Service Mesh** - Advanced traffic management
2. **Database Per Service** - Independent data stores
3. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Asynchronous communication
