The Vedas are ancient Sanskrit texts that form the foundation of Hindu philosophy and spirituality.
        They contain hymns, prayers, and rituals that have been preserved for thousands of years.
        
        The four main Vedas are:
        1. Rigveda - Collection of hymns and prayers
        2. Samaveda - Musical chants and melodies
        3. Yajurveda - Ritual formulas and procedures
        4. Atharvaveda - Spells, charms, and everyday wisdom
        
        These texts represent the earliest form of Indian literature and contain profound
        philosophical insights about the nature of reality, consciousness, and the divine.
